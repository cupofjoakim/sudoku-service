# Sudoku service

A small microservice to generate a simple sudoku puzzle. Uses Babel for ES6 and will use jest for testing (when i get to it). Built during a hack evening at SBAB in Karlstad, Sweden.

## Getting started

```sh
# Install dependencies
yarn
```

Then you can begin development:

```sh
# yarn
yarn run dev
```

This will launch a [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) process for automatic server restarts when your code changes.
